# README

This is a Pinterest-clone following the tutorial by [Mackenzie Child](https://mackenziechild.me/) in his
[12-apps-in-12-weeks](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/) series.  
* The video for the tutorial is located here: [Week 6: How To Build A Movie Review App With Rails 4](https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/5/) and here: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DR5JLZ2Qgg&index=5&list=PL23ZvcdS3XPLNdRYB_QyomQsShx59tpc-)
* Mackenzie's GitHub repo for this project is here: [movie_review](https://github.com/mackenziechild/movie_review)

* The last 30 minutes or so were dedicated to adding the ratings gem and search gem which I did not do.
